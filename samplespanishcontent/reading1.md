English Reading 1:

There was once a man who had a red hat. The hat was made of velvet and leather. The hat was tall, large and heavy. The man wore the hat only to birthdays and to weddings. But why did he wear such a strange object? Well, when the man was a child, his father told him, ´son, in life, you need not have explanations for the way that you want to express yourself, do what you want, wear what you want and act how you want and you will be happy´. As such, the man remembered this interesting piece of advice and wore his strange red hat proudly.
